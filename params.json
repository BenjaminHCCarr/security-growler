Or... if you simply like having information about people using your computer's resources.\r\n\r\nIt's easily extensible in Python, you can add modules that watch ports for connetions or parse logfiles.\r\nYou can even forward alerts as push notifications to your iOS devices using [Prowl](http://prowlapp.com/).\r\n\r\n\r\n## Install:\r\n1. Download and run [Security Growler.app >>](https://github.com/pirate/security-growler/raw/master/Security%20Growler.app.zip)\r\n2. Click on the menubar icon once to start detecting events.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://pirate.github.io/security-growler/screenshots/menubar_2.PNG\" width=\"45%\"/>\r\n<img src=\"http://pirate.github.io/security-growler/screenshots/menubar_1.PNG\" width=\"45%\"/>\r\n\r\nIf you prefer [Growl](http://growl.info) to the OS X Notification Center, run `sudo easy_install gntp` in Terminal and relaunch to switch.\r\n\r\n\r\n## It can do cool things like:\r\n\r\n**Alert you to attempted and succesfull SSH logins:**\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://pirate.github.io/security-growler/screenshots/ssh_fail_event.PNG\" width=\"40%\"/>\r\n<img src=\"http://pirate.github.io/security-growler/screenshots/ssh_key_event.PNG\" width=\"40%\"/>\r\n\r\n**Notify you of arbitrary TCP connections: VNC, FTP, SMB, MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.:**\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://pirate.github.io/security-growler/screenshots/vnc_event.PNG\" width=\"40%\"/>\r\n<img src=\"http://pirate.github.io/security-growler/screenshots/connection_event.PNG\" width=\"40%\"/>\r\n\r\n**Notify you whenever a command is run with `sudo`:**\r\n\r\n<!-- ![](http://pirate.github.io/security-growler/screenshots/sudo_event.PNG) -->\r\n<img src=\"http://pirate.github.io/security-growler/screenshots/sudo_context.PNG\" height=\"350px\"/>\r\n\r\n**Let you know when you're being portscanned:**\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://pirate.github.io/security-growler/screenshots/portscan_context.PNG\" height=\"350px\"/>\r\n\r\n[More Screenshots...](https://github.com/pirate/security-growler/tree/gh-pages/screenshots)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Documentation:\r\n\r\nThe currently working notifiers are:\r\n\r\n * SSH\r\n * FTP\r\n * SMB\r\n * AFP\r\n * VNC\r\n * MySQL\r\n * PostgreSQL\r\n * iTunes Sharing\r\n * sudo commands\r\n * port-scans (e.g. if you're on the receiving end of nmap)\r\n\r\nSettings are changed by editing a text file `settings.py`, accesible via the menubar dropdown item 'Settings...'.\r\n\r\n**To enable or disable alert types:**\r\n\r\nYou can enable and disable certain alerts by editing the `WATCHED_SOURCES` section of the file.\r\nSimply add or remove event sources on the left (either port numbers or logfile paths), and put the parsers you want to enable on the right.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# e.g. this config only alerts for FTP, iTunes Sharing, sudo, & SSH\r\nWATCHED_SOURCES = {\r\n    21:                    'connections',      # FTP\r\n    3689:                  'connections',      # iTunes Sharing\r\n    '/var/log/system.log': ('sudo', 'ssh'),    # sudo & ssh\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To enable or disable alert channels, such as Notifcation Center or Growl:**\r\n\r\nEdit the settings file by using the 'Settings...' dropdown item.\r\nChange the `LOGGERS` section to suit your needs.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nLOGGERS = [\r\n    'stdout',\r\n    'logfile',\r\n    'growl',\r\n    # 'osxnotifications',  # prepend a hash to disable a certain channel\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\n**To change event display preferences:**\r\n\r\nEdit the settings file by using the 'Settings...' dropdown item.\r\n\r\nChange `POLLING_SPEED` to make the app update more or less frequently (2-10 seconds is recommended).\r\nChange the `INFO_` and `ALERT_` items to modify properties such as alert sounds, icons, and text.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Developer Info:\r\n\r\nThis app is composed of 3 main parts: `sources`, `parsers`, and `loggers`.\r\n\r\n * [`sources`](https://github.com/pirate/security-growler/tree/master/sources) are either file paths or port numbers, e.g. `/var/log/system.log` or `5900`\r\n * [`parsers`](https://github.com/pirate/security-growler/tree/master/parsers) take the text from the `sources`, and parse out various alerts, e.g. `ssh` or `sudo`\r\n * [`loggers`](https://github.com/pirate/security-growler/tree/master/loggers) are output channels for alerts, e.g. `stdout`, `osxnotifications`, or `growl`\r\n\r\nThe main runloop is in [`growler.py`](https://github.com/pirate/security-growler/blob/master/growler.py), it reads lines out of the sources, passes them through parsers, then dispatches alerts before waiting a short delay and then looping.\r\n\r\nThe [menubar app](https://github.com/pirate/security-growler/tree/master/Security%20Growler.app/Contents/Resources) is a simple wrapper compiled using [Platypus](http://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/12046/platypus).  `Security Growler.app` is packaged with copies of `growler.py` and all the other files it needs.\r\nTo make changes to the app, change the files you need, test using `sudo python growler.py` and `sudo ./menubar.sh`, then re-run Platypus to generate a new app.\r\n\r\nThe menubar app works by simply running `growler.py` (which writes to a log file), then `cat`ing the contents of the logfile to show in the dropdown.\r\nSee [`menubar.sh`](https://github.com/pirate/security-growler/blob/master/menubar.sh) for more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Background:\r\n\r\nI was tired of not being able to find an app that would quell my paranoia about open ports, so I made one myself. Now I can relax whenever I'm in a seedy internet cafe or connected to free Boingo airport wifi because I know if anyone is trying to connect to my computer.\r\n\r\nFeel free to submit a [pull-request](https://github.com/pirate/security-growler/pulls) and add a [new parser](https://github.com/pirate/security-growler/blob/master/parsers/vnc.py) (e.g. try writing one for http-auth)!\r\n\r\nA related project is available for Linux users: [PushAlotAuth](https://github.com/benjojo/PushAlotAuth), it uses the PushALot push-notification platform.\r\n\r\n\r\n## License:\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, pulverize, distribute, synergize, compost, defenestrate, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n\r\nIf the Author of the Software (the \"Author\") needs a place to crash and you have a sofa available, you should maybe give the Author a break and let him sleep on your couch.\r\n\r\nIf you are caught in a dire situation wherein you only have enough time to save one person out of a group, and the Author is a member of that group, you must save the Author.\r\n\r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BLAH BLAH BLAH ISN'T IT FUNNY HOW UPPER-CASE MAKES IT SOUND LIKE THE LICENSE IS ANGRY AND SHOUTING AT YOU.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://pirate.github.io/security-growler/screenshots/menubar_3.PNG\" width=\"100%\"/>\r\n",
